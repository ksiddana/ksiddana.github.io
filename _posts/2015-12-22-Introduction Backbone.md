title: Backbone Introduction
---

Your still probably wondering, why do we have to write so much code for displaying lists and currently not so powerful feature rich websites. These are called single page applications. Backbone consists of building web pages using the following architectures:

- Models
- Views
- Collections
- Routers

In order to undersand the ease with which Backbone lets you render your page and does a whole lot of rendering behind the scenes, you have to setup your project as a Backbone Model. I personally took a long time to understand the need of using Backbone as a single page application, knowing that jQuery if not equal but is way powerful in building responsive web applications.
