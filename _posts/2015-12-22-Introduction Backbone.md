title: Backbone Introduction

Your probably wondering, why do we have to write so much code for displaying HTML elements that don't currently have a feature rich component. These are called single page applications. Backbone consists of building web pages using the following architectures:

- Models
- Views
- Collections
- Routers

In order to undersand the ease with which Backbone lets you render your page, you have to have built a large project in jQuery using JSON API, that eventually all becomes difficult to siff through. Backbone arised from the need of organizing your code, so we could write with the same feature rich intensity that jQuery gives you but also keeps your code in an organized. 

I personally took a long time to understand the need of using Backbone as a single page application, knowing that jQuery if not equal but was way powerful and easy to understand while building responsive web applications.
